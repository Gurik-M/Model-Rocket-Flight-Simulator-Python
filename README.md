# Model-Rocket-Flight-Simulator-Python
A model rocket flight simulator coded in python. 
This command line based simulator uses calculus based kinematics to calculate maximum altitude, velocity, recommended delay charge, net force, and the aerodynamic drag value, all to a high degree of accuracy. Specific model engine data is stored in an accompanying data file which can be modified for custom engines.
